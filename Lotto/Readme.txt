Some extra information:
1. The files are saved as *.yln. Standing for Your Lotto Numbers.
2. To use the check the number option you must open a saved document from the program.
3. The button I used a new xp style addon from PSC. So you going to have to follow the instructions in the SmartNetButton text file to add the component if you do not have it.
4. I've gone over the program quite a lot so ther should not be any problems. If you find a problem please notify me.

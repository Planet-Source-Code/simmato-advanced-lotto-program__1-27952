Please vote for the program if you like it.
Some extra information:

1. You have probably noticed 2 folders. One of them uses the smartnet buttons and the other doesn't. The smartnet buttons are an .net style type button but you need to download the zip from smartnet.com (full link - http://www.vbsmart.com/library/smartnetbutton/SmartNetButton.zip) and follow the instructions to put new component on. Once put on just goto add components and in the control look for VBsmart .net button.
The reason why I did put the files with this zip as they are *.dll and *.ocx so PSC doesn't allow this.

2. The files are saved as *.yln. Standing for Your Lotto Numbers.

3. To use the check the number option you must open a saved document from the program.

4. I've gone over the program quite a lot so there should not be any problems. If you find a problem please notify me.
